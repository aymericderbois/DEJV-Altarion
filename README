ALTARION: UNIVERSAL SUPREMACY

DISCLAIMER:
	this game has been developed and tested on Linux and Mac OS X systems,
	you might compile it for windows but at your own risks.
	
BUILD:

	Altarion depends on SFML 2.0, you'll need to install it before you go further.
	
	Linux/Mac OS:
		$> ./configure
		$> make
		$> ./UniversalSupremacy
	
	Alternatively you can build an Xcode project:
		$> cmake -G Xcode
		$> open UniversalSupremacy.xcodeproj
		then click "build & run" (the first time will fail at linking and the second will succeed)
		
		we highly recommand you use cmake in a separate directory, 
		if so, please also copy the "ressources" directory to your target directory.
